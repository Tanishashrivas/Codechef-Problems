/*Ques: In Chefland, there are N houses numbered from 11 to NN, i^{th}
  house has a defence system having strength A_i.
Chef suspects a bomb drop on one of the houses very soon. A bomb with attack strength XX can destroy the i^{th}
  house, if the defence system of the i^{th}house A_i,is strictly less than X.

Also, when the i^{th}house is destroyed due to the bomb, all houses with indices j such that 1â‰¤j<i get destroyed as well irrespective of their defence system.
Given one bomb with attack strength X, find the maximum number of houses that can get destroyed.*/
